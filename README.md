## Disclaimer

:warning: **DANGER OF ELECTROCUTION** :warning:

If your device connects to mains electricity (AC power) there is danger of electrocution if not installed properly. If you don't know how to install it, please call an electrician (***Beware:*** certain countries prohibit installation without a licensed electrician present). Remember: _**SAFETY FIRST**_. It is not worth the risk to yourself, your family and your home if you don't know exactly what you are doing. Never tinker or try to flash a device using the serial programming interface while it is connected to MAINS ELECTRICITY (AC power).

We don't take any responsibility nor liability for using this software nor for the installation or any tips, advice, videos, etc. given by any member of this site or any related site.

## Note

Please do not ask to add new devices unless it requires additional code for new features. If the device is not listed as a module, try using [Templates](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Templates) first. If it is not listed in the [Tasmota Device Templates Repository](http://templates.blakadder.com) create your own [Template](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Templates#creating-your-template).

## Important User Compilation Information
If you want to compile Tasmota yourself keep in mind the following:

- For ESP8285 based devices only Flash Mode **DOUT** is supported. Do not use Flash Mode DIO / QIO / QOUT as it might seem to brick your device.
- For ESP8285 based devices Tasmota uses a 1M linker script WITHOUT spiffs **1M (no SPIFFS)** for optimal code space.
- To make compile time changes to Tasmota use the `user_config_override.h` file. It assures keeping your custom settings when you download and compile a new version. You have to make a copy from the provided `user_config_override_sample.h` file and add your setting overrides.

## Configuration Information

Please refer to the installation and configuration articles in our [documentation](https://tasmota.github.io/docs).
